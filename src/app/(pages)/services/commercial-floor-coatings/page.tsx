  {
    question: 'Can your coatings handle forklift and heavy equipment traffic?',
    answer: 'Yes. Our commercial-grade coating systems are specifically engineered for heavy traffic loads. We\'ve coated warehouses with constant forklift traffic, loading docks with pallet jack use, and manufacturing floors with heavy machinery.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you minimize disruption to business operations?',

  },
  {
    question: 'Do you provide different slip-resistance levels for different areas?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. We customize slip resistance based on each area\'s specific needs - smooth finishes for easy cleaning in some areas, textured surfaces for safety in others. We meet OSHA requirements for workplace safety.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What chemicals can the coating resist?',
    answer: 'Our commercial systems handle a wide range of industrial chemicals including oils, solvents, acids, cleaning chemicals, and automotive fluids. We can specify systems based on your specific chemical exposure needs.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle large commercial projects?',

  },
  {
    question: 'What kind of warranty do you provide for commercial installations?',
    answer: 'Commercial projects receive comprehensive warranties covering materials and labor. Warranty terms are tailored to usage levels and maintenance agreements. We stand behind our work with responsive service support.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you work around existing equipment and operations?',
    answer: 'Yes. We regularly work in active facilities, carefully protecting equipment and coordinating with operations schedules. We can phase installations to keep critical areas operational during the coating process.'

                Your business floors work harder than any surface in your facility. Constant foot traffic, 
                heavy equipment, chemical exposure, and daily wear create ongoing maintenance challenges that 
                drain your budget and disrupt operations. Damaged concrete doesn't just look unprofessional - 
                it creates safety hazards, harbor contaminants, and force expensive repairs.

              <p>
                Our commercial polyaspartic floor coating systems solve these problems permanently. From

                reduce maintenance costs, improve safety, and enhance their professional image with surfaces 
                that perform under the most demanding conditions.
