    question: 'Will the coating be slippery when wet?',

  {
    question: 'How does the coating handle pool chemicals?',
    answer: 'Our polyaspartic pool deck coatings are formulated specifically for chemical resistance. They handle chlorine, bromine, salt water, and cleaning chemicals without fading, staining, or deteriorating.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Will the surface be too hot to walk on barefoot?',
    answer: 'Our cool-deck technology reflects heat rather than absorbing it. While no surface stays completely cool in Florida sun, our coating remains significantly more comfortable than plain concrete or many other materials.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you coat around existing pool coping and equipment?',
    answer: 'Yes. We work carefully around existing coping, ladders, handrails, and equipment. Our system bonds well to properly prepared concrete regardless of the surrounding fixtures.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long before we can use the pool after installation?',
    answer: 'The coating is ready for foot traffic within hours. However, we recommend waiting 24 hours before heavy use and returning pool equipment to service to ensure complete cure.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if there are cracks in the existing deck?',
    answer: 'We address all cracks during preparation. Minor cracks are filled and sealed. Larger structural issues are repaired before coating to prevent future problems.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you clean algae or stains from the coated surface?',
    answer: 'The non-porous surface makes cleaning easy. Most stains and algae rinse away with a hose. Stubborn spots respond well to mild pressure washing or scrubbing with pool deck cleaners.'

                Your pool should be a place of relaxation and fun, not worry about slips, burns, or maintenance headaches. 
                Florida's intense sun makes concrete pool decks dangerously hot, while constant moisture creates slippery 
                conditions that lead to accidents. Traditional concrete also absorbs pool chemicals, leading to staining, 
                deterioration, and costly repairs.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Our specialized pool deck coatings solve these problems with engineered surfaces that prioritize safety 
                and comfort. From Ponte Vedra Beach resort pools to backyard family pools in St. Johns County, we've 
                installed slip-resistant, chemical-resistant surfaces that keep swimmers safe while looking beautiful 
                year after year.
