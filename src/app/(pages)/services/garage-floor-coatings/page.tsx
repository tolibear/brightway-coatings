  {
    question: 'How long does a garage floor coating installation take?',
    answer: 'Most residential garages are completed in a single day. We start 8AM and typically finish by 5PM. The floor is ready to walk on in 24 hours and vehicles ready to drive in 72 hours.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Will the coating peel up from hot tires like epoxy does?',
    answer: 'No. This is one of the biggest advantages of polyaspartic over polyurea. Our polyaspartic system has excellent heat resistance and will not soften or peel from hot tires, even during Florida\'s hottest summer days.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you coat over existing epoxy that\'s failing?',
    answer: 'Absolutely not. Every coating we install must be poured on fresh ground concrete. If there are any previous failed epoxy coatings we make sure to professionally remove them and continue with our grind prep.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if I spill oil or other fluids on the floor?',
    answer: 'Simply wipe it up. Our polyaspartic coating is non-porous and chemical resistant. Motor oil, brake fluid, antifreeze, and other automotive fluids will not stain or penetrate the surface.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I choose decorative flake colors?',
    answer: 'We bring sample boards showing popular flake combinations that work well with different home styles. Many customers choose neutral blends that complement their home\'s exterior or go with bold colors that hide dirt and tire marks.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is the coating slippery when wet?',
    answer: 'No more than regular concrete. The decorative flakes actually provide texture that improves traction. For additional slip resistance, we can add texture additives to the topcoat.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What kind of warranty do you provide?',
    answer: 'We provide a comprehensive 15 year warranty covering materials and labor. This covers delamination, cracking and yellowing of coating. Normal wear from proper use is expected over many years.'

                  Your Jacksonville garage floor takes a beating from Florida's harsh conditions. Hot sun, oil spills, chemical exposure, and constant traffic 
                  demand a durable poly concrete coating system that can handle it all. Traditional garage floor epoxy looks good initially but fails when 
                  you need it most - peeling from hot tires, yellowing under Jacksonville's intense UV exposure, and staining from automotive fluids.

                  lasts decades, not years - far superior to basic garage epoxy options.
