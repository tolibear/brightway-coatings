const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'Can you coat basement floors with moisture issues?',
    answer: 'Yes, but proper preparation is essential. We test for moisture levels and use specialized primers when needed. Our coatings can serve as a moisture vapor barrier, but severe water intrusion issues should be addressed first.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What areas of my home can be coated?',
    answer: 'We coat any concrete surface: basements, sunrooms, workshops, laundry rooms, storage areas, driveways, walkways, and patios. Each area gets a system designed for its specific use and exposure conditions.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle temperature changes in enclosed spaces?',
    answer: 'Our polyaspartic system maintains flexibility through temperature swings. Unlike rigid epoxy that can crack, our coating moves with the concrete as it expands and contracts.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Will the coating work in high-humidity areas like Florida?',
    answer: "Absolutely. Our system is specifically designed for Florida's climate. The non-porous surface prevents moisture absorption and resists mold and mildew growth."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you match colors to my home's interior design?",
    answer: 'We offer a wide range of solid colors and decorative flake systems. We can help you choose options that complement your existing d√©cor and design preferences.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long do residential coatings typically last?',
    answer: "With proper maintenance, our residential coatings last decades. We provide 15 year warranties because we're confident in the long-term performance of our polyaspartic systems."
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you handle furniture and equipment moving?',
    answer: "We can help move lighter items, but large furniture and equipment should be removed before we arrive. We'll provide specific preparation instructions based on your project."

                Your home's concrete surfaces work hard every day, but they don't have to look worn out. From 
                basement moisture problems to garage oil stains, from sunroom temperature swings to driveway 
                weather damage, unprotected concrete creates ongoing maintenance headaches and reduces your 
                property value.
