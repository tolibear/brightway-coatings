# Performance & UX Rules

## Core Performance Standards

### Image Optimization
- All images must be WebP format with fallbacks
- Hero background videos under 6MB, optimized for web
- Lazy loading for images below the fold
- Responsive images with proper srcset attributes
- Alt text required for all images (accessibility + SEO)

### Loading Performance
- Core Web Vitals targets: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
- Critical CSS inlined for above-the-fold content
- Non-critical JavaScript deferred or loaded asynchronously
- Preload important fonts and hero images

### Mobile-First Requirements
- All layouts must work perfectly on 320px screens
- Touch targets minimum 44px × 44px
- Click-to-call phone number (904-671-2686) prominent on mobile
- Sticky mobile CTA bar with phone number
- Forms optimized for mobile input (proper keyboard types)

## User Experience Guidelines
