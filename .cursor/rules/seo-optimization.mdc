# SEO Optimization Rules

## Page-Level SEO Requirements

### Title Tags & Meta Descriptions
- Title tags: 50-60 characters, include service + "Jacksonville" or "St. Johns"
- Meta descriptions: 140-160 characters with clear benefit + CTA
- Every page needs unique titles and descriptions
- Example: "Garage Floor Coatings Jacksonville FL | 1-Day Install | Brightway"

### Content Structure
- H1 must be unique per page and match search intent
- Include primary keyword in first 100 words
- Use H2/H3 for sections: Benefits → Process → FAQs → Local Trust
- Every service page mentions "Jacksonville", "St. Johns", or neighborhoods

### Local SEO Targeting
**Primary locations to mention:**
- Jacksonville, St. Johns, St. Augustine, Ponte Vedra, Orange Park
- Fleming Island, Nocatee, Mandarin, Julington Creek

**Primary keywords per page:**
- Homepage: "concrete coatings Jacksonville"  
- Garage: "garage floor coating Jacksonville"
- Patio: "patio coating Jacksonville"
- Pool Deck: "pool deck coating Jacksonville"
- Commercial: "commercial floor coating Jacksonville"

### Technical SEO
- JSON-LD structured data on every page (LocalBusiness schema)
- Service schema for each service page
- FAQPage schema for FAQ sections
- Clean URLs with hyphens: `/garage-floor-coatings-jacksonville`
- Internal linking: home → services, services cross-link to each other

### Image SEO
- All images must have descriptive alt text
- Include location in alt text: "garage floor coating in Nocatee neighborhood"
- WebP format for performance
- Descriptive filenames, not generic numbers

## Content Guidelines
- Lead with benefits, not features
